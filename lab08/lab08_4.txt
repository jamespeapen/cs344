a. The K-fold validation allows the model to be trained on the whole dataset
while validating each fold with data it was not trained on. This improves the
models accuracy more than if it was trained on just a subset of the data.

b. Having widely different ranges due to outliers would affect the model
because it would take those values into account even though they are not
representative of the data and this would skew the model.

c. Making a large network on a small dataset could cause overfitting because
there is only a little training data available and only so much training that
can reasonably be done. Using a smaller network reduces the overfitting.
