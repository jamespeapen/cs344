Exercise 10.3

a. The confusion matrix shows, for each image, the predicted value and the
proportion of real values that matched that prediction. It helps to see how
well the model is predicting true labels. 

b.  The Tensorflow model uses a neural network, but the model from class uses a
convolutional neural network that doesn't just use the full image, but also
captures information about parts of the images and how they relate to each
other. I wasn't able to get the accuracy of the lab's network higher than 95%.

c. The 10 step model plots look like noise without any discernable patterns
while the 1000 step model has patterns emerging in the upper layers and all the
plots in the deeper layers have patterns to them. Some of the plots have blurry 
numbers in them.
