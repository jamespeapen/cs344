    " - The Turing Test - a test of AI that passes if the human interrogator cannot tell if their partner is human or a computer. This requires:\n",
    "      - **natural language** processing to communicate\n",
    "      - **knowledge representation** to store what it learns\n",
    "      - **automated reasoning** to use stored information and draw new conclusions\n",

    "### Describe:\n",
    " - Physical Symbol System hypothesis: since human thinking is symbol manipulation, machines that can emulate that symbolic thought are intelligent.\n",
    " - Expert Systems: A computer that emulates the decision making ability of a human expert.\n",
    " - Symbolic vs. Logicist vs. Connectionist models: \n",
    "     - Symbolic: models based on symbolic representations of problems and search methods\n",
    "     - Logicist: using logic notation to describe objects and the relationships between them\n",
    "     - Connectionist: Based on calculations rather than representations of real world objects to sovle problems\n",
