3.1
a. Easy:
Depth-first search: fail
AC3: solves quickly
backtracking_search: solves, slowly
min_conflicts: fail

hard-aima:
depth_first_graph_search: took too long to finish
AC3: failed quickly
backtracking_search with mrv and forward_checking: solved quickly
backtracking_search: took too long to finish
min_conflicts: failed slowly

hardest_escargot:
AC3: failed 
backtracking_search with mrv and forward_checking: solved quickly

b. With forward_checking, backtracking_search solved the easy puzzle quickly. With mrv enabled, it solves it quickly. With both enabled, three is no noticable increase in speed. 
With harder_aima_csp, it failed quickly.

3.2
a. n = 8
AC3: failed
backtracking_search: solved with all backtracking_search settings
min_conflicts: solved

n = 20 
AC3: 
backtracking_search: with default settings: solved with a delay
	with mrv and forward_checking: solved with a smaller delay
min_conflicts: solved quickly

b. Backtracking works best with the minimum remaining values and forward_checking enabled. These settings allow it to 

n = 100
backtracking_search: works only with both mrv and forward_checking
min_conflicts: solved

c. Min-conflicts requires
