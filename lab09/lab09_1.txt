Exercise 9.1

a. The linear regression does not make useful predictions. The histogram shows
that most of its predicts are between 0 and 0.25 while we would like a
prediction as close to 0 or 1 as possible.

b. L2 loss shows the squares of the residuals and tries to minimize it. In a
classification model, the linear regression does not treat the predictions as
binary classification, but a linear model and so does not do a good job of
classifying.  LogLoss is the cross-entropy loss that measures loss as binary
classsification errors and can penalize for classification errors and for
confidence errors.

c. The logistic regression has RMSE values that decrease over each training
period while the linear regression had teh same error values for each period
which means it was not learning. 

d. 
learning_rate = 0.00005
steps = 50000
batch_size = 2000
AUC: 0.82
Accuracy = 0.80
