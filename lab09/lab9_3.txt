Exercise 9.3

1. 3 hidden layers
During the 15 epoch run, using three layers instead of two layers gets the
validation loss higher and both the training accuracy and validation accuracy
are more varied. There isn't a significant difference between the accuracy
scores of the two and three layer models. After cutting down to 2 epochs
because the graph showed that that was where the accuracy peaked, the max
accuracy was 86% which is lower than the two layer models accuracy.
Increasing the number of layers probably led to overfitting which resulted
in poor perfomance on the held-out test dataset. 

2. 32 units in a hidden layer
Using two layers and 32 hidden units, the accuracy could be increased to 89% 
with 2 epochs. Having more units allowed the model to learn more complex 
representations and captured more of the review patterns, increasing 
accuracy. 

3. Using mse
Using mse did not increase the model's perfomance on the testing set. 

4. Using tanh instead of relu
Using tanh with 4 epochs did not increase the accuracy, but with 2 epochs, 
the accuracy went from 88% to 89%, possibly because overfitting was reduced
with only 2 epochs.
