Exercise 9.2 

a. We are regularizing with respect to sparcity because it reduces
the number of parameter in the model allowing for better utilization
of resources while maintaining performance and preventing overfitting.

b. L1 regularization increases sparcity by penalizing the absolute value of the weights and pushing some of the less meaningful parameter weights to 0.
c. regularization_strength=0.8
