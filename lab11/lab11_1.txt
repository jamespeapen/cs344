Exercise 11.1

a. A linear model may be preferable is the if the task is data and the patterns in it are simple enough to be fitted well 
with a linear regression. Using a deep neural network for a simple problem would run the risk of overfitting and using more
resources to run. 

b. The neural network has around a 10% higher accuracy than the linear model and does not have much more overfitting. Both 
models have similar training and testing accuracy scores. 

c. With the embeddings, the neural network had a similar accuracy to the linear model. 

d. disappointment and terrible are quite close together in the word vector plot and this makes sense because they are both 
negative words and would be used in a negative review. 

e. Learning rate = 0.2
Accuracy = 0.85
