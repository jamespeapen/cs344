Exercise 11.2

a. Race: Within race, there is more data for White than for any other, and
compared to White, others like American-Indian are extremely underrepresented.
Gender: Similarly, males are more represented in the gender set than females
and this skews the data.  Income: The data is biased towards incomes less than
50K.  Native country: Bias towards United States Capital: Both capital gains
and loss have over 90% zeros in them. The log plot shows that most people dont'
have much capital gains, but there are some at the higher end of the gain
spectrum who make gains.

b.Looking at occupation against income bracket, colored by gender, you can see
than most occupations in the lower income bracket are dominated by men while a
few have more women. In the higher income bracker, all the categories are
dominated by men. A model trained on this data would learn these patterns and
if used to adivse policy, it could further propagate inequalites in gender and
income.  

c. 

d. Looking at a matrix for race and comparing White and Black, there are more
false negatives for income over 50K for Black than true positives. The model is
not good at classifying Black income brackets because it is biased towards
classifying them in a lower income bracket and gets it wrong more often than
right. This pattern was there when looking at gender as well. Women were 
predicted to earn less more often than they did in reality.
