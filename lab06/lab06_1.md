# Exercise 6.1

if Hungry, 1, 4, 8, 8, and 12 will wait and 2 and 10 will not wait
if not Hungry, 3 will wait and 5, 7, 9, and 11 will not wait.

$ Gain(Hungry) = 1 - [\frac{7}{12}B(\frac{5}{12}) + \frac{5}{12}B(\frac{1}{12})] $
$ B(\frac{5}{12}) = -(\frac{5}{12}log_2(\frac{5}{12}) + (1-\frac{5}{12})log_2(1-\frac{5}{12})) = 0.98$
$ B(\frac{1}{2}) = -(\frac{1}{2}log_2(\frac{1}{2}) + (1-\frac{1}{2})log_2(1-\frac{1}{2})) = 1$

$ Gain(Hungry) = 1 - [\frac{7}{12}(0.98) + \frac{5}{12}(1)] = 0.012$

This would be better than the gain from *Type*, but is not as good as the gain from *Patrons*.
