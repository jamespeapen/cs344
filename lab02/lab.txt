a. Hill-climbing solution, simulated annealing

b. Both algorithms seem to work at the same speed.

c. The starting value does not seem to make a difference in the solution values. There is only one maximum and random starting values don't affect the algorithm's ability to find it. 

d. After changing the delta to 0.1, hill climbing value was closer to the maximum than the simluated annealing. Reducing the delta further to 0.01 shows similar results with hill-climbing getting better results than simulated annealing. The delta value controls the range that th e search function is allowed to search in. A lower delta prevents simulated annealing from finding the maximum because it is restricted in its search by that small range. Hill-climbing works with that smaller range because it works towards the maximum with that range. 

e. exp_shedule() controls the inital temperature, the maximum temperature and the cooling as the algorithm progresses and maps time to temperature.
