Exercise 7.3

a.  1.  california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] =
california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"]/california_housing_dataframe["population"]

calibration_data = train_model( learning_rate=0.05, steps=500, batch_size=5,
input_feature="rooms_per_person"

2.  plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6)) plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2) _ = california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].hist(

RMSE: 132.43

3.  california_housing_dataframe["clipped_rooms_per_person"] =
california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].apply(lambda x: min(x, 10))
calibration_data = train_model( learning_rate=0.05, steps=500, batch_size=5,
input_feature="clipped_rooms_per_person")

RMSE: 114.63

b. Synthetic features are features that do not exist in the dataset, but are
created using the dataset. Using synthetic features allows us to use variables
not in the original dataset that better capture the goals than the original
dataset. Variables like densities and rates may be better than raw counts and
models can use synthetic features to provide better results.

c. Outliers are the extremem minimum and maximum values in the dataset that
have few counts, but can reduce model perfomance. These are identified with
histograms and can be clipped to keep only the most representative data points
and improve the model.
