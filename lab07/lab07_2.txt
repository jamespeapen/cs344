Exercise 7.2

a. 

b. train_model( learning_rate=0.00002, steps=500, batch_size=5)

Final RMSE: 167.23

c. Hyperparameters are parameters that cannot be estimated from the data and
need to be set before the learning process. They influence the learning and can
determine how well a model fits the data. There isn't a standard tuning
algorithm to get a good set of hyperparameters. They need to be set depending
on the data and the root mean squared error and is more a trial-and-error
process.
